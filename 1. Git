 						Git

1.what is git
Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history.
2.difference between centralized version control system [cvcs] and distributed version control system [dvcs]
Cvcs is sub version - source code can put in single place
Dvcs is github  - source code can put in multiple place

3. Git stages
Stages of git:
1. Working directory: we write the source code.
2. Staging area: we can track the code. Is also called as draft space.
3. Repository: we can store our tracked code. (.git is your local repo)
4. What is merge
Adding  files in one branch to another branch. Is called merge
5. Git merge vs rebase
Merge  shows list of files but rebase will not show
Rebase show branch
Merge shows history
6. What is github ?
Its a place where we can store code on internet.
Everyone can access the code.
Daily we can do push and pull activites.
7. What is local repository & central repository ?  Bare and non-bare ?
Local repository :  empty git repository [ .git]      command is -  git init
Central repository : github
Bare : empty
Non-bare : which is having code
8. What is merge conflicts ?
When we merge 2 different branches with common files with different content conflicts will occur.
We need to resolve these conficts   manually.
9. Whis id git clone & git fork ? Clone & pull ?
Git clone: getting the repository to local
Git fork: getting the repository to github
Clone: ropositoy
Pull : file
10. What is fetch vs pull ?
Fetch : to show the difference in files
Pull : to get the difference in files
11. What is cherry-pick ?
To get specific files to one branch to another branch
12. What is git stash ? Difference between pop and clear ?
Git stash : used to hide the files which are not committed.
Git stash pop	: to remove last stash
Git stash clear	: to remove all stash
13. What is git revert ?
Git revert: to undo the merging blw branches.
13. What is git restore?
Git restore: used to undo the tracked files.

14. Which language is used in git?

Git is written in c, reducing the overhead of runtimes associated with higher-level languages.
15. What is the purpose of 'git config'?
The 'git config' is a great method to configure your choice for the git installation. Using this command, you can describe the repository behavior, preferences, and user information.

16. What does 'hooks' comprise of in git?
Git hooks are scripts that run automatically every time a particular event occurs in a git repository
Client-side hooks: these hooks are executed on the local machine. They are triggered by events such as committing, pushing, and merging.
Server-side hooks: these hooks are executed on the remote server. They are triggered by events such as receiving pushed commits

17. What is the distinction between git and github?

I . Git is a correction control framework, a tool to deal with your source code history.

Ii . Github is a hosting function for git storehouses.

18. Describing branching systems you have utilized?

Gitflow: gitflow is a branching model that is designed for larger projects. It has four main branches:
Master: the master branch is the main development branch. It should only contain production-ready code.
Develop: the develop branch is the main branch where new features are developed.
Feature: feature branches are used to develop new features. They are created from the develop branch and merged back into the develop branch when the feature is complete.
Hotfix: hotfix branches are used to fix critical bugs in production. They are created from the master branch and merged back into the master branch as soon as possible.
Github flow: github flow is a simpler branching model that is designed for smaller projects. It has two main branches:
Main: the main branch is the main development branch. It should only contain production-ready code.
Feature: feature branches are used to develop new features. They are created from the main branch and merged back into the main branch when the feature is complete.

19. Mention the various git repository hosting functions.
The following are the git repository hosting functions:

Pikacode
Visual studio online
Github
Gitenterprise
Sourceforge.net

20. Mention some of the best graphical git customers for linux?
Some of the best git customer for linux is

Git cola
Smart git
Git-g
Git gui
Giggle
Qgit

21. What is subgit? Why use it?
Subgit is a tool for a smooth, stress-free svn to git migration.
